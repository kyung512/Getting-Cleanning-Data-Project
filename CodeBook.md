### Introduction
The purpose of this project is to practice how to collect, work with, and clean a data set.
a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.
### Data
 Data was collected in the experiments carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. 
Here are the data for the project: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
The dataset includes the following files:
- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

There are 30 subjects and 6 activities labeled 1 through 6
1.	Walking
2.	Walking_Upstairs
3.	Walking_Downstairs
4.	Sitting
5.	Standing
6.	Laying
Files, y_train.txt and y_test.txt, contain ‘activity’ number identifiers(1-6) and subect_train.txt and ‘subject_test.txt’ files contain subject information(1-30).
